From antiquity to the present, human societies have had a rich and uneasy
relationship to water, with many of the world's great cities rising on the
shores of rivers, lakes, seas, and oceans. Their histories have been shaped by
the opportunities and hazards of these nearby waters. Today, many population
centers now also lie in the cross-hairs of climate change, which accelerates
sea-level rise and alters the frequency and magnitude of flooding and severe
storms.

This interdisciplinary class will explore legendary floods and the
physical and cultural phenomena of the worldâ€™s "drowning cities," bringing
together diverse perspectives from environmental science and the history of
architecture, engineering, and urbanism.

We will use varied modes of evidence,
inference, and analysis to understand past, present, and futures in the Near
East, Europe, Asia, and North America, including Nashville, New Orleans, and
New York.

We will explore different approaches for communicating about climate
and cities, including interactive mapping.
