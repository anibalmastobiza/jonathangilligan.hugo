incorporating behavioral, cultural, social, and political considerations into

in the context of the IPCC process.

## Abstract:

> Limiting global warming to 2&deg;C or less compared with pre-industrial 
> temperatures will require unprecedented rates of decarbonization globally. 
> The scale and scope of transformational change required across sectors and 
> actors in society raises critical questions of feasibility. 
> Much of the literature on mitigation pathways addresses technological and 
> economic aspects of feasibility, but overlooks the behavioral, cultural, and 
> social factors that affect theoretical and practical mitigation pathways. 
> We present a tripartite framework that "unpacks"" the concept of mitigation 
> pathways by distinguishing three factors that together determine actual 
> mitigation: technical potential, initiative feasibility, and behavioral 
> plasticity. 
> The framework aims to integrate and streamline heterogeneous disciplinary 
> research traditions toward a more comprehensive and transparent approach that 
> will facilitate learning across disciplines and enable mitigation pathways to 
> more fully reflect available knowledge. 
> We offer three suggestions for integrating the tripartite framework into 
> current research on climate change mitigation.

## Why the Human Factor Is so Important

The vast majority of integrated assessment models used to study possible 
future greenhouse gas emissions pathways focus on technological-economic models 
in which emissions are driven by a combination of economic activity 
(which drives production and consumption of goods and services) and 
technological innnovation, which drives trends in the energy-intensity and 
greenhouse-gas emissions intensity of economic activity. These models generally 
reduce human decision-making and behavior to a quasi-rational effort to 
maximize consumption.

In fact, we know very well that human behavior is far more complex and reducing
it to its purely economic aspects misses important aspects of behavior. 
Moreover, the possibilities for changing the world's emissions trajectory
depends strongly on what is politically possible. Many of the policy measures
favored by both economists and activists, such as taxing emissions, face 
daunting political obstacles that have prevented them from being seriously 
considered by policymakers.

## Three-Part Analysis Framework

In this paper, we argue that a three-part analysis framework that Mike 
Vandenbergh and I have been advocating, can be helpful in improving the analysis
and modeling of future greenhouse gas emissions.
This framework considers emissions reduction in terms of _technical potential_
(**TP**), _behavioral plasticity_ (**BP**), and _initiative feasibility_ 
(**IF**).

_Technical potential_ refers to the emissions reduction that a an action would
produce if everyone who could take it did so. For instance, if everyone who 
could do so would commute to and from work by carpool or public transit.

_Behavioral plasticity_ refers to the fraction of people who would choose to 
take an action. Even when it is possible to do so, very few people will choose 
to carpool or use transit. This causes actual emissions reductions to be 
less than the technical potential in most cases.
Behavior can be influenced by a variety of factors, such as economic incentives
(e.g., rebates, tax breaks, or other subsidies for buying an electric car),
marketing, convenience (making it easier to use an alternate means of commuting),
and social influences (e.g., peer pressure from friends, family, co-workers, 
etc. to use carpools or public transit).
Policies that recognize and address obstacles to behavior change are likely to 
be more effective than those that don't.

_Initiative feasibility_ refers to the political obstacles to enacting and 
implementing new environmental policies. There is broad agreement among most 
economists---both liberal and conservative---that charging a price for 
greenhouse gas emissions, either through carbon taxes or tradeable permits, 
would have a powerful effect in reducing emissions, but these policies are very
controversial and have encountered powerful opposition, not only in the United
States, but throughout the world, as we have seen in Australia's repeal of its
emissions-pricing law in 2014, or in the _gilets jaunes_ uprising in France
against President Macron's emission-pricing policy.

## Incorporating the Framework into Integrated Assessment Models

In many cases, empirical research allows us to make quantitative estimates of 
BP, but in other cases there isn't data and it becomes necessary to 
use guesswork to estimate BP by analogy to areas where there is data. 

Initiative feasibility is even more difficult and there are no reliable methods
for quantitatively assessing the probability of enacting a new policy or the 
effectiveness that policy is likely to have in practice. 

Future modeling studies will need to contend with the difficulty of assessing
BP and IF. We suggest that initially, expert elicitation or survey methods may
be able to provide exogenous estimates of BP and IF, but we observe that both
BP and IF are context dependent, so it would be especially valuable if modelers
can find ways to treat these endogenously.
